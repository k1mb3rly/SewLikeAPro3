  <!-- Two Families -->
  <div class="callout callout-technique">
    <h4>Key Concept: Two Families</h4>
    <p>All pieces belong to one of two groups:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Jacket Family</strong> includes the front jacket, back jacket, and under collar.</li>
      <li><strong>The Facing Family</strong> includes the front facing, back neck facing, and top collar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each family gets assembled separately, then the two families are joined together. <strong>Center back seams match to center back seams</strong> — that's how you remember which collar goes where.</p>

          <li><strong>Press your muslin.</strong> If any edge was cut rather than ripped, rip it so the grain is even, then block and press.</li>
          <li><strong>Fold muslin in half</strong>, selvage to selvage, with the fold on one side.</li>
          <li><strong>Lay pattern pieces</strong> as directed to fit on the fabric. Pieces on fold go along the folded edge; all others are placed on the doubled fabric.</li>
          <li><strong>Trace and cut.</strong> Mark all notches. Remember: "cut 2" on a pattern means cut 2 pieces of fabric, not trace the pattern twice — folded fabric gives you two pieces from one cut.</li>

      <h3>Understanding the Two Collars</h3>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>

    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">
        <p><strong>Top collar:</strong> Single piece, cut on fold, on regular grain. This is the collar you actually see when the jacket is worn. It goes with the <strong>facing family</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Under collar:</strong> Two pieces with a center back seam, cut on bias. This sits underneath and against the neck. It goes with the <strong>jacket family</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Why bias?</strong> The under collar sits closest to your neck with layers on top of it (interfacing, top collar). Cutting it on bias allows it to mold and give around the curve of your neck. The top collar is just a finishing piece on top — it doesn't need the same flexibility.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
          <p>If you ever buy a commercial blazer pattern and the under collar is NOT marked for bias cutting, <strong>cut it on bias anyway</strong>. This is the level-up step that gives a noticeably better fit around the neck.</p>
