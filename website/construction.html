  <h1>Part 3: Notch Collar Construction</h1>
  <p>Step-by-step assembly in four phases.</p>
</header>

<main class="container">

  <p>All seam allowances are &frac12; inch. All seams are standard right-sides-together. No fancy seam finishes are needed because this is a lined jacket — lining covers all raw edges. Press every seam open at the iron to reduce bulk.</p>

  <div class="callout callout-important">
    <h4>IMPORTANT</h4>
    <p>Pressing seam allowances open is <strong>critical</strong>. With medium-weight fabric plus interfacing, closed or flat seam allowances create bulky ridges that show on the outside of the garment. Press open at every stage.</p>

  <!-- Phase 1 -->
  <div class="collapsible">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h2><span class="phase-badge">Phase 1</span> Assemble the Jacket Family</h2>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step A: Join the Under Collar</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Place the two under collar pieces right sides together along the short center back edge.</li>
            <li>Sew at &frac12; inch seam allowance.</li>
            <li>Press the seam open.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step B: Assemble the Jacket Body</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sew the center back seam of the back jacket (the slightly curved seam). Press open.</li>
            <li>Attach front jacket pieces to back jacket at the shoulder seams, right sides together. Press open.</li>
            <li>Sew the side seams. Press open.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <h4>Efficiency Tip</h4>
          <p>Do all your pinning first, then sew all the seams in a batch, then press everything open at once. Don't run back and forth between the machine and the iron for each individual seam.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step C: Attach the Under Collar to the Jacket</h4>
          <p>This is the first tricky part of the notch collar. The collar's flat neck edge must wrap around the jacket's curved neckline, which means managing fullness at the shoulder points.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Match the center back seam of the under collar to the center back seam of the jacket. Pin.</li>
            <li>The ends of the collar should reach the front notch on each side. Line up and pin each end at the notch.</li>
            <li>Match collar to the shoulder seam on each side. Pin, making sure the shoulder seam allowance is pressed open underneath.</li>
            <li>Pin the spaces between (center back to shoulder, shoulder to notch).</li>
            <li>Sew at &frac12; inch. Begin at one front notch and sew toward the center back and around to the other notch.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-technique">
          <h4>KEY TECHNIQUE: Managing Fullness at the Shoulders</h4>
          <p>As you sew from the flat collar into the curved neckline, you'll feel extra fabric bunching up at the shoulder area. This is normal. Here's the procedure:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sew smoothly from the notch toward the shoulder.</li>
            <li>When you feel the bulk building at the shoulder, <strong>STOP</strong>.</li>
            <li>Put the needle <strong>DOWN</strong> into the fabric.</li>
            <li>Lift the presser foot.</li>
            <li>Reach underneath the collar and <strong>PUSH all the fullness behind the needle</strong>, out of the way.</li>
            <li>Put the presser foot back down and continue sewing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>It doesn't matter if the fabric is bunchy behind the needle — you're not sewing in that direction. Do NOT rely on the feed dogs to sort this out; they pull fabric through but won't redistribute fullness. If you sew over the bulk, you'll get a tuck or pleat sewn into the seam.</p>
        </div>

        <p>After sewing, press this seam open.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h2><span class="phase-badge">Phase 2</span> Assemble the Facing Family</h2>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step D: Join the Facing Pieces</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sew front facings to the back neck facing at the shoulder seams, right sides together. Press open.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step E: Attach the Top Collar to the Facing</h4>
          <p>The top collar has no center back seam, so mark the center back yourself by folding the collar's straight edge in half and notching.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Match the center back of the top collar to the center back of the facing. Pin.</li>
            <li>Match collar ends to the front notches. Pin.</li>
            <li>Pin shoulders and fill in between.</li>
            <li>Sew at &frac12; inch, using the same needle-down/push-fullness technique at the shoulders.</li>
            <li>Press the seam open.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Phase 3 -->
  <div class="collapsible">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h2><span class="phase-badge">Phase 3</span> Join the Two Families</h2>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step F: Pin the Families Together</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Lay the facing family on top of the jacket family, right sides together.</li>
            <li>Match and pin the collar corners/notches first — this is the most critical alignment point.</li>
            <li>Pin the center back of the collars together.</li>
            <li>Pin the shoulders (seam allowances pressed open).</li>
            <li>Pin along the front edges, all the way down. This jacket has no zipper — the facing continues to the bottom.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step G: Sew Around the Perimeter</h4>
          <p>Starting from the bottom of one front facing, you will sew continuously up the front, around the collar, and down the other front. The sewing path has multiple pivot points.</p>
          <p><strong>Sewing path:</strong> Up the front edge &rarr; pivot at the collar notch corner (90&deg;) &rarr; onto the collar &rarr; pivot at the collar point &rarr; around the curved outer collar edge &rarr; pivot at the second collar point &rarr; back down onto the jacket &rarr; pivot at the second notch corner &rarr; down the other front edge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-important">
          <h4>IMPORTANT</h4>
          <p>At each collar notch corner, you must <strong>sew ONTO the collar before pivoting</strong> — don't just pivot at the edge or you'll end up off the collar. Similarly, when coming off the collar, make sure you get below your clip and stitch line before pivoting back onto the jacket body. Both corners must match each other exactly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-technique">
          <h4>Pivot Technique Reminder</h4>
          <p>At every corner: stop with needle down, lift presser foot, rotate fabric, lower presser foot, continue. If your notch clip isn't deep enough to let the fabric open flat at the pivot, you can deepen it slightly — just <strong>never clip past your stitch line</strong>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Phase 4 -->
  <div class="collapsible">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h2><span class="phase-badge">Phase 4</span> Clip, Clean, and Turn</h2>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step H: Clipping</h4>
          <p>Clipping is what allows the collar to turn cleanly. Every clip matters.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bottom front corners:</strong> clip diagonally across the corner.</li>
            <li><strong>Upper collar corners</strong> (where collar meets notch): clip diagonally.</li>
            <li><strong>Curved outer collar edge:</strong> clip multiple small cuts around the curve. The edges near the corners are curvier and need more clips than the center.</li>
            <li><strong>Notch corners</strong> (the 90&deg; angles): clip into the corner without hitting your stitching. The clip must allow the seam to open into a completely straight line. If it doesn't fully open, the corner will be bunchy when turned.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step I: Clean Out Seam Allowances</h4>
          <p>After clipping, use your point turner or fingers to clean all seam allowance bulk out of the corners and curves. This is especially important with thicker fabrics and interfacing on the actual blazer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step J: Turn and Press</h4>
          <p>Turn the collar right side out through the bottom. Use a point turner to push out all corners cleanly. Press flat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-note">
          <h4>Note on Topstitching</h4>
          <p>This blazer will NOT use topstitching to hold the collar flat (unlike the Sew Like a Pro 2 jacket). High-end blazers keep the collar in place through <strong>precise pressing techniques</strong>, which will be covered when you construct the actual jacket. For the muslin practice, a regular press is sufficient.</p>
