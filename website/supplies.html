  <h2>Required Materials</h2>

  <!-- 1. Jacket Fabric -->
  <div class="collapsible open">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h3>1. Jacket Fabric (Shell)</h3>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">
        <p><strong>Wool suiting</strong> is the recommended go-to fiber. Look for a medium-weight blazer wool — not as light as shirting and not as heavy as coating. It should feel like something you'd expect a blazer to be made from.</p>
        <p>If you don't want wool, any <strong>woven, non-stretch, 60-inch-wide fabric in a medium weight</strong> will work. Cotton, linen, and polyester blends are all acceptable as long as the hand and weight make sense for a jacket.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-important">
          <h4>IMPORTANT</h4>
          <p>Do not spend more than <strong>$20/yard</strong> on wool suiting. B&amp;J Fabrics (referred to as "Chic" in class) carries affordable suiting on the right wall near the entrance. Avoid:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Upholstery fabric</li>
            <li>Velvet/corduroy (pile adds difficulty with pressing and cutting direction)</li>
            <li>Coating-weight wool</li>
          </ul>

  <!-- 2. Lining Fabric -->
  <div class="collapsible open">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h3>2. Lining Fabric</h3>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">
        <p>You need a lining that is <strong>slightly lighter in weight</strong> than your shell fabric, with a compatible body and hand. You are not limited to fabrics marketed as "lining."</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Silk habotai</strong> (also called China silk) — traditional, lightweight, not overly expensive</li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight cotton</strong> or cotton blends</li>
          <li><strong>Cupro or Bemberg rayon</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Polyester lining</strong> (the $0.99/yard option works but is staticky and harder to handle)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <h4>Lining Tip</h4>
          <p>If you buy the cheap polyester lining, consider using a scrap of <strong>cotton or muslin for your welt pocket bags</strong> instead. Pockets take wear and tear, and flimsy poly won't hold up as well. Otherwise, your jacket lining can double as your welt pocket lining.</p>

  <!-- 3. Interfacing -->
  <div class="collapsible open">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h3>3. Interfacing</h3>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">
        <p>You need <strong>weft fusible interfacing</strong> — the same type used for the welt pocket practice. This will <strong>not</strong> be available at B&amp;J (Chic). You'll need to shop at a notions-focused store or order online.</p>
        <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Pacific Trimming, Steinlauf &amp; Stoller, SIL Thread, or Panda (all in NYC's Garment District). It comes in dark gray/black and white — choose based on your fabric color.</p>

  <!-- 4. Thread -->
  <div class="collapsible open">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h3>4. Thread</h3>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">
        <p>Match your thread color to your jacket fabric. <strong>Polyester all-purpose thread</strong> is fine. Cotton thread works but can snap more easily — if you go 100% cotton, test it by pulling a length from the spool. If it breaks immediately, skip it.</p>

  <!-- 5. Shoulder Pads -->
  <div class="collapsible open">
    <div class="collapsible-header">
      <h3>5. Shoulder Pads &amp; Sleeve Heads (Not Needed Yet)</h3>
      <span class="collapsible-chevron"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="collapsible-content-inner">
        <p>These are needed later in the construction process, not for next class.</p>
        <p><strong>Shoulder pads:</strong> Get the <strong>uncovered type</strong> (batting covered in muslin, open on all edges). Do NOT buy the kind covered in polyester fabric — those are for tacking into finished garments, not for building into a lined jacket. Standard thickness is &frac12; inch. Available in black or white.</p>
        <p><strong>Sleeve heads:</strong> A long, thin rectangle of batting folded over with muslin sewn on. These support the top of the sleeve cap so it doesn't collapse inward when the shoulder pad is installed. Your instructor can email photos if you want to buy these early.</p>
